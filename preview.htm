<H2>Pokémon Stadium</H2>
We have been waiting for Pokémon Stadium for quite a while now and it finally has a firm release date for
<B>March 23rd</B>. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an 
adventure theme like the gameboy versions. Instead,
you battle your pokémon against the computer's, or even
 a friend's in a stadium (hence the name Pokémon <U>
Stadium</U>). 
<BR>
You can use the pokémon you've trained yourself on your Gameboy game, or, if you don't have a Gameboy, you can 
buy some in a little shop in the game. To use the ones from your Gameboy, you need a device called a Tranfer Pak to move the monsters from Gameboy to N64. It is compatible with the Red, Blue, and Yellow versions of the game. Luckily, it comes 
packaged with the game for free so you don't have to buy it
 seperately. At least we know Nintendo realises that we are not made of money!
<BR>
The Transfer Pak will also be compatible with the upcoming game, Perfect Dark which, apparently, will be able to put your face onto a character using the Gameboy Camera.
<BR>
Like in Pokémon Snap, there is also an option where you
can take pictures of your pokémon in battle and print it out at participating stores. But what I think will be 
the most interesting to check out will be the ability to play Pokémon Red, Blue and Yellow on your TV. No more squinting at a smaller screen on your pocket pal.
<BR>
Being a Pokémon fan myself, all I can say is...CAN'T WAIT!

<H2>Pokémon Gold and Silver</H2>
Pokémon Gold and Silver versions are already out in Japan (of course!) but Australia has heard little about the games. What we  know is that it will be in full <B>color</B>, not just green with a few shades of color thrown over like Yellow's attempt. There will be a whole new world to explore and complete which is fantastic. We have also been informed that there will be an addition of <FONT SIZE="+1">100</FONT> new Pokémon for trainers to catch and train. That means that  the lovable <B>Togapie</B> will be available to catch! But as usual, you can't get every Pokémon on one version. In fact, you can't get them all on both! You need the Red and Blue versions to trade over these Pokémon :
<ul>
<li>Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur
<li>Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard
<li>Squirtle, Wartortle, Blastoise
<li>Omanyte, Omanstar, Kabuto, Kabutops (the fossils)
<li>Articuno, Moltres, Zapdos (the lengendary birds)
<li>Mewtwo and Mew (how annoying!)
</ul>

Yes, this does mean that you can trade Pokémon with the Red and Blue versions onto the Gold and Silver versions
and vise versa <b><u>BUT</u></b> (and that's a big BUT) 
you can only trade Pokémon 1-51 (from Bulbasaur to Mew)
and if you want to trade them back they can't have learnt any of the new moves in the new games. For example, if you trade over a squirtle then teach it a new move such as 'waterfall' and then try to trade it back to Red/Blue it won't work. 
<p>
There is also a Pokémon which is just like Mew. It looks different, but has to be caught the same way. That's right, there's gonna be another PokéTour! Its name is <b>Selebi</b> and it is number 251.
<p>
The first thing you will notice when you turn on the game is that you no longer play as Ash! There is a new boy you control by the name of <b>Hiro</b> and he looks a little different from Ash. Second, you don't pick from Bulbasaur, Charmander or Squirtle at the start. You choose from 3 new ones: Chikorita (grass), Cyndaquil (fire), or Totodile (water).

<p>Another HUGE new feature is the cool option of breeding Pokémon!!! You see, every Pokémon you catch or fight is either a male or a female. You can tell its gender by looking at the end of its name and you will see either a male or female symbol after it. On route 34, there is a little breeding centre run by an old lady and an old man. If you have 2 of the same Pokémon with different genders, then give the female to the old lady and the male to the old man. After a while when you come back you can get your Pokémon back and they will also give you an egg. This egg will hatch and you will have a little baby Pokèmon who will grow up to be an adult Pokémon! This is how you can get lots of copies of your favourite Pokémon. The only problem is, a few Pokémon have no genders so you can't breed them! They are the legendary bird Pokémon, Mew, Mewtwo and some Pokémon who aren't really animal-like.
<p>
Other cool features include time passing in real time with day and night (some Pokémon only come out at night), 2 new HM's, and new Pokéballs for catching different types of Pokémon. AND last but not least once you have completed the game you can get on a boat and it will ferry you across to the old world from the Red/Blue versions! From there you can complete that game over again in full color! 
<p>
I have reserved my copies of Gold and Silver already. I can't wait for them to come out! They are released <font size=+1>12th October</font>.

<h2>Hey you, Pikachu!</h2>
Hey you, Pikachu! has been available for yonks in Japan and us Aussies have hardly even heard of it.
Hey you, Pikachu! is a bit like a Tamagotchi for your N64. Only with this game, you use a headset and microphone to play the game. And of course it stars Pikachu. What you do is talk to him, encourage him, tell him off or whatever, and he recognises your voice and the tone, so if you start yelling at him, he'll look all sad and might even cry! You are not just looking after him, you have to guide him through different tasks. One is helping a Bulbasaur make his lunch! Unfortunately though, it will not be released in Australia because of difficulties Nintendo has had translating the game. So that's another Pokémon game we will never see outside Japan...
