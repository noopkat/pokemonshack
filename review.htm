Pokémon Red and Blue on the gameboy were the games that started off the whole Pokémon craze over the world. When Pokémon was first introduced to Australia, it wasn't expected to get very far at all. Just look at it now!!! You can buy just about anything to do with Pokémon you want, including a Pokédex like Ash has in the cartoon! Anyway, back to the games...
<p>
The whole idea of catching little monsters that can be stored in balls that fit in your pocket is a great idea. Even better is that you can train them up and then pit them against somebody else's to see who spent more time with theirs'. It's a little like a Digimon (a tamagotchi monster you fight against your friends with.) but bigger and better. One good thing is, you don't have to feed it, amuse it and look after it like a real pet or little monster. And if you raise it's level too high too quickly, it won't listen to you. So the basic idea to Pokémon is to catch all available Pokémon and train them to their best ability. Which is a lot more fun than it sounds! You can also trade Pokémon with your friends providing you have a link cable. And cleverly, you can only get some Pokémon on the Red version and vice versa. So you have to know someone who has the other version to you so you can trade for the Pokémon that aren't on your version (or buy both games). Another option with the link cable is to have a battle against your friend's Pokémon that they've trained themselves. This is quite fun as the winner usually brags for a week until the loser gets sick of it!
<p>
RPG lovers would (and do) adore this game because it does have a lot of bits in it where you talk to people in the game and interact with them. That's what stops the training part getting boring. Some of the things the people in the game say when you beat them are quite funny!
Buying one or both of these versions if you haven't already would be a wise choice even if you aren't really into Pokémon. It keeps you going for weeks and months on end trying to catch that last Pokémon or begging your friends for a trade.
<p>
Definately worth buying. Score: 9/10 (some color would have been nice but it was brought out a bit early for that.)

As the Pokémon craze got bigger, Nintendo decided to release another version for the gameboy. Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition sold millions of copies in the first week over Australia!
<p>
Basicaly it's the same game as Red and Blue but instead of choosing from Bulbasaur, Squirtle or Charmander at the start of the game, you get a Pikachu, and Gary gets an Eevee. You still need the Red and Blue versions to catch all 150 Pokémon (151 including Mew) and finish the game that way.
<p>
There are still some little differences besides the starting Pokémon. For instance, in certain parts of the game you can get Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander from people in the game, instead of having to trade them over. Secondly, All the Pokémon have been updated with new pictures and information of them. There is also a bit of color in it, for example, a Pidgy has been colored brown, buts it's only one color for each one so it's feet aren't pink they're brown also. The towns seem to have their own color schemes too, but it's fairly dull.<p>
Team Rocket's Jesse and James make an appearance several times in the game as well! They have Ekans, Koffing and Meowth to battle you with and later on Arbok and Weezing.
But the best thing by far is having Pikachu follow you around, just like Ash's from the cartoon. When you first get it, it won't stay in the Pokéball so it walks around behind you for the rest of the game. You can turn to Pikachu and see his mood as well. If you give it some health or rare candy, it will love you. But at the start of the game, it always looks unhappy. Be sure not to trade it to another version and back, because it will get mad at you! The funniest bit about this is when Pikachu falls in love with a Clefairy in Vermillian City!! You have to see his face.
He also talks with a real voice, which, although a little static, is really cute!
So, iif you are a Pokémaniac, it is definately worth buying this game. I give it 9.5/10. Gold and Silver versions will hopefully be a bit more different to Red and Blue than Yellow is.

<H2><center>Pokémon Snap</center></H2>
Pokémon Snap is the first Pokémon game to come to the N64, and it's quite faithful to Pokémon. Fans saw their favourite Pokémon in 3d for the first time.<p>
The object of Pokémon Snap is to take good pictures of Pokémon to get a high score. High scores mean you get new items to use and new trails are opened up with new Pokémon waiting for you.<p>
It's quite a nice idea for a game, and the first time you play it you think, oh look! It's a Pikachu! How cute!! and stuff like that because they do actually move around like little animals and hide when you want to take a picture. If you get a high score the first thing you get are apples which you throw at the Pokémon so they'll turn around to eat it. You can lure them somewhere with a line of apples if you want, too. The second item you get is Pester Balls. These force shy Pokémon out in the open to get a shot of them. They also can cause certain Pokémon to evolve if they get hit by one. The third item is a faster engine for the buggy you drive around in on the tracks.<p>
When I first played this game at my cousin's house I thought that you could  run around free but you can't. You're in a buggy driving on like a railway track quite slowly. This was annoying at first but you get used to it and get to like it because it's slow enough for you to turn and get that shot of a bird Pokémon you passed already that is flying away. <p>
This is a very enjoyable game, however it would have been nice if all 151 Pokémon had have been included. This game only features 63 which is a shame. But it still will keep you going as you try to get better and better pictures. There is a cool option on it where you put your 4 favourite pictures in a gallery on the game, then take the cart to Toys 'R' us and print them out as stickers for $5 dollars a sheet. Cool huh?<p>
I rate this game 8.5/10 - it should have been made a little more difficult and all 151 Pokémon would have been nice.
