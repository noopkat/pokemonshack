<H3>100 item trick *</H3>
This trick will give you over 100 of an item.
<BR>
Make sure that the item you want 100 of is in 
<B>6th</B> position in your item list.Go to Viridian City
 and talk to the guy who just had his coffee. Let him 
show you how to catch a Weedle. After he has fly to 
Cinnabar Island and surf up and down the coast on the
right. After a while a Pokémon called Missing no or M-#
should appear. DO NOT try to catch them as doing this can stuff up your
game. Just choose to run away and look in your item list. Next to
the 6th item should be a symbol. This means you have
about 130 of that item. This glitch is especially
handy for Rare Candy and Masterballs!
<P>
<H3>Catching Rare Pokémon</H3>
Here's a quick tip for when you are catching rare Pokémon you don't want to miss
like Mewtwo or the legendary bird Pokémon. Just before
you confront them, <B>save your game</B>. This way,
if you accidently make them faint, you can reset your
gameboy and try again.

<H3>Invisible Computer *</H3>
If you visit the hotel in Celadon City, you will notice that the room looks a bit like the Pokémon
Center. It does in a few other ways. Stand at the far
right side of the room in front of where the computer should be if it was the
Pokémon Center (in other words, pretend the computer is invisible and
get in a position so you can turn it on). Press A and 
a computer will click on! This computer is exactly like
any other, it's just invisible!
<P>
<H3>Extra Potion</H3>
When you first start a new game, and you start off in your house, turn your computer
on and you will find a potion in there! This is handy
in case you get in trouble while battling Gary in
Oak's Lab.
<P>
<H3>Swim near SS Anne</H3>
Here's a useless little trick that you can do for fun.
Don't go on the SS Anne until one of your Pokémon knows Surf
(you will need to trade a Pokémon to another version to
teach it Cut, then trade it back again to avoid getting on the SS Anne). when you have done this,
show the man your SS Ticket and when it shows the bit
where you walk along the bridge to get on the ship, Turn and face either the left side
or right. Then use your Pokémon to Surf in the water around the ship.
If you go to the right side, you will see a truck parked there. (In Yellow version, it is not there.)
Apparently, in the Japanese version of this game, if you
found a set of keys and drove the truck across a bit, Mew would be
hiding underneath. This was taken out of the Australian
version though, unfortunately, so it won't work.
<P>
<H3>Funny Statues</H3>
If you fly to Cerulean City and enter Misty's Gym, the
statues can also used for fishing. Just cast your rod while
facing one and you should be catching water Pokémon in
no time! Again this trick is useless; it's just for fun.
<P>
<H3>Easy to Catch Safari Pokémon *</H3>
If there is a particularly hard to catch Pokémon in the
Safari Zone for you, like Tauros or Kangaskhan, then
this might make it easier. Go to the area where that Pokémon
appears. Walk around in that patch of grass until time's
up, then fly to Cinnabar Island and surf up and down
the right coastline again. After a while the Pokémon
you just saw in the Safari Zone will appear. Just keep running away
until the one you want comes up. You will be able to fight
it properly now and it won't run away. *Note* you have to have seen the Pokémon you
want to catch at least once just before you fly to Cinnabar Island. You can't just
have seen it and then fly to Cinnabar Island the next day.
